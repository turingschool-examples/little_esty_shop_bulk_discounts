Extensions
When an invoice is pending, a merchant should not be able to delete or edit a bulk discount that applies to any of their items on that invoice.
When an Admin marks an invoice as “completed”, then the discount percentage should be stored on the invoice item record so that it can be referenced later
Merchants should not be able to create/edit bulk discounts if they already have a discount in the system that would prevent the new discount from being applied (see example 4)

Holiday Discount Extensions:
Create a Holiday Discount

As a merchant,
when I visit the discounts index page,
In the Holiday Discounts section, I see a `create discount` button next to each of the 3 upcoming holidays.
When I click on the button I am taken to a new discount form that has the form fields auto populated with the following:

   Discount name: <name of holiday> discount
   Percentage Discount: 30
   Quantity Threshold: 2

I can leave the information as is, or modify it before saving.
I should be redirected to the discounts index page where I see the newly created discount added to the list of discounts.
View a Holiday Discount

As a merchant (if I have created a holiday discount for a specific holiday),
when I visit the discount index page,
within the `Upcoming Holidays` section I should not see the button to 'create a discount' next to that holiday,
instead I should see a `view discount` link.
When I click the link I am taken to the discount show page for that holiday discount.
