## Completion Goals

- Bulk discount is 100% complete
- Students use the principles of MVC to effectively organize code with only 1 - 2 infractions. Routes and Actions mostly follow RESTful conventions
- ActiveRecord helpers are utilized most of the time. ActiveRecord grouping, aggregating, and joining is used to process data at least once. Queries are functional and accurate.
- 100% coverage for models. 98% coverage for features. Tests are well written and meaningful. All tests passing. TDD Process is clear throughout commits. Some sad path and edge case testing. Tests utilize within blocks to target specific areas of a page.

## Learning Goals
- Write migrations to create tables and relationships between tables
- Implement CRUD functionality for a resource using forms (form_tag or form_with), buttons, and links
- Use MVC to organize code effectively, limiting the amount of logic included in views and controllers
- Use built-in ActiveRecord methods to join multiple tables of data, make calculations, and group data based on one or more attributes
- Write model tests that fully cover the data logic of the application
- Write feature tests that fully cover the functionality of the application

## Bulk Discounts
Bulk Discounts are subject to the following criteria:

- Bulk discounts should have a percentage discount as well as a quantity threshold

- Bulk discounts should belong to a Merchant

- A Bulk discount is eligible for all items that the merchant sells. Bulk discounts for one merchant should not affect items sold by another merchant

- Merchants can have multiple bulk discounts

- If an item meets the quantity threshold for multiple bulk discounts, only the one with the greatest percentage discount should be applied

- Bulk discounts should apply on a per-item basis

- If the quantity of an item ordered meets or exceeds the quantity threshold, then the percentage discount should apply to that item only. Other items that did not meet the quantity threshold will not be affected.

- The quantities of items ordered cannot be added together to meet the quantity thresholds, e.g. a customer cannot order 1 of Item A and 1 of Item B to meet a quantity threshold of 2. They must order 2 or Item A and/or 2 of Item B

## Examples

##### Example 1

Merchant A has one Bulk Discount
Bulk Discount A is 20% off 10 items
Invoice A includes two of Merchant A’s items
Item A is ordered in a quantity of 5
Item B is ordered in a quantity of 5
In this example, no bulk discounts should be applied.

##### Example 2

Merchant A has one Bulk Discount
Bulk Discount A is 20% off 10 items
Invoice A includes two of Merchant A’s items
Item A is ordered in a quantity of 10
Item B is ordered in a quantity of 5
In this example, Item A should be discounted at 20% off. Item B should not be discounted.

##### Example 3

Merchant A has two Bulk Discounts
Bulk Discount A is 20% off 10 items
Bulk Discount B is 30% off 15 items
Invoice A includes two of Merchant A’s items
Item A is ordered in a quantity of 12
Item B is ordered in a quantity of 15
In this example, Item A should discounted at 20% off, and Item B should discounted at 30% off.

##### Example 4

Merchant A has two Bulk Discounts
Bulk Discount A is 20% off 10 items
Bulk Discount B is 15% off 15 items
Invoice A includes two of Merchant A’s items
Item A is ordered in a quantity of 12
Item B is ordered in a quantity of 15
In this example, Both Item A and Item B should discounted at 20% off. Additionally, there is no scenario where Bulk Discount B can ever be applied.

###### Example 5

Merchant A has two Bulk Discounts
Bulk Discount A is 20% off 10 items
Bulk Discount B is 30% off 15 items
Merchant B has no Bulk Discounts
Invoice A includes two of Merchant A’s items
Item A1 is ordered in a quantity of 12
Item A2 is ordered in a quantity of 15
Invoice A also includes one of Merchant B’s items
Item B is ordered in a quantity of 15
In this example, Item A1 should discounted at 20% off, and Item A2 should discounted at 30% off. Item B should not be discounted.

### Extensions
When an invoice is pending, a merchant should not be able to delete or edit a bulk discount that applies to any of their items on that invoice.
When an Admin marks an invoice as “completed”, then the discount percentage should be stored on the invoice item record so that it can be referenced later
Merchants should not be able to create/edit bulk discounts if they already have a discount in the system that would prevent the new discount from being applied (see example 4)
Holiday Discount Extensions

##### Create a Holiday Discount

As a merchant,
when I visit the discounts index page,
In the Holiday Discounts section, I see a `create discount` button next to each of the 3 upcoming holidays.
When I click on the button I am taken to a new discount form that has the form fields auto populated with the following:

Discount name: <name of holiday> discount
Percentage Discount: 30
Quantity Threshold: 2

I can leave the information as is, or modify it before saving.
I should be redirected to the discounts index page where I see the newly created discount added to the list of discounts.

##### View a Holiday Discount

As a merchant (if I have created a holiday discount for a specific holiday),
when I visit the discount index page,
within the `Upcoming Holidays` section I should not see the button to 'create a discount' next to that holiday,
instead I should see a `view discount` link.
When I click the link I am taken to the discount show page for that holiday discount.
